This program takes in integer values, and puts them into a dynamic array. Then the dynamic array is copied into a second array. This second array will then be sorted using the quicksort algorithm. Afterwards, the orignal dynamic array and the sorted array are checked to see how many values match. Finally, we check to see if the target value is in the array, and if it is then we also
check if it is in a correctly sorted position. If it is, then we print out the first matching position of the target value.
